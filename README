Used to peform audit of configuration specifically to ensure all transceivers are configured
PyEZ is the library used here to peform the work.
The "show chassis hardware" representative table in PyEZ (jnpr.junos.op.xcvr import XcvrTable) 
is retrieved and then checked to see if each transceiver is in the config using a custom Interface Config Table.
